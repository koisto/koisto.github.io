# Try Hack Me - Kenobi

This is a walkthrough of the [Kenobi Room](https://tryhackme.com/room/kenobi), a guided CTF from [Try Hack Me](https://tryhackme.com/).

This CTF was carried out using a local install of Kali Linux. The machine to be exploited was accessed by VPN.

Once the kenobi virtual machine started and the IP address was displayed I assigned the address to a variable to use for the duration of the excercise.

```bash
$ IPADDR=<ip address of vm given by tryhackme>
```
## Initial scan for open ports
An initial scan of open TCP ports on the machine was carried out using nmap.

```bash
$ nmap -sT -oN nmap_ports.txt $IPADDR
```

The scan results tell us that there are 7 ports open.

```txt
# nmap_ports.txt

# Nmap 7.91 scan initiated Wed Mar 24 09:53:47 2021 as: nmap -sT -oN nmap_ports.txt 10.10.203.161

2049/tcp open  nfs

# Nmap done at Wed Mar 24 09:53:48 2021 -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.91 seconds
```
## Enumeration of SMB shares
Using the built in scripting features of nmap the SMB shares and users are enumerated.

```bash
$ nmap -p 445 --script=smb-enum-shares.nse,smb-enum-users.nse -oN nmap_snb.txt $IPADDR
```

```txt
# nmap_snb.txt

The anonymous share maps onto a folder under kenobi's account.

## Examining SMB share
Login to the anonymous share and list directory contents.

```bash
$ smbclient //10.10.203.161/anonymous

Download the contents of the share (a single file called log.txt)

```bash

We have the location of kenobi's ssh keys and also the name of the FTP server.
